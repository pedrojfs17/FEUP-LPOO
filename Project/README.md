# POKÉMON
In this totally new game (please don't sue us Nintendo), you are the
character **X** (for now). Your task is... pretty non-existent... but,
you can have fun battling other pokémons you find in the wild.

This project is being developed by Gonçalo Alves (up201806451@fe.up.pt) and
Pedro Seixas (up201806227@fe.up.pt) for LPOO 2019/20
